# Geekbench6-data-analysis-tool
This program is a python script that given a valid geekbench 6 test URL of a Samsung Galaxy device it will download the code and analyze the data that appears in the test.

In this new version of the program Geekbench has removed the identification tags of each value of the dictionary, which is a shame, because know there is no way to really get the data you need, right now this script only works with some Samsung galaxy devices, I will need to understand how does geekbench assign each "id" value to each phone data. Here is an example:
